                    Support To Society: With the objective of supporting the community we are in, a School at Kolar Gold Fields that requires our intervention was visited by Com. Arunan, Vineeth VS and Sathian in June 2022. This School has Pre-Primary, Primary and Secondary classes. The students are from poor backgrounds. They are the children of daily wagers of the area. The school is supported by the CPM for its operation. The number of teachers is less than the number of the classes/divisions. The salary for the teachers is very low and is not paid regularly. There is no support up to 7th standard from the government, and the school is managed with the meagre fees of Rs.200/ month received from students. Bangalore chapter started the support for the school in Nov-2022. Initially, we set up a library and sports equipment for the children. Major support provided on an ongoing basis is the salary for two teachers (12000/-), textbooks and notebooks for students during the start of the academic year, awards to students for sports and arts competitions, etc. Our team provides guidance on improving the quality of teaching as well. Also, with support from the US chapter, we are providing egg supplements to all primary school children. We have conducted three visits during the year to discuss the progress, conduct workshops and attend the award Ceremony.
