                    Darsana North America is one of our youngest chapters, with 29 members from the USA and three from Canada. According to Darsana's executive committee guidance, various efforts have been undertaken to identify more members from the North American region and bring them to leadership.
                    One of the flagship Programs of the Darsana US chapter is to collaborate with the Indian community in the US/Canada to fund house construction projects for the marginalized community. Last year, we successfully collaborated with the Kerala Cultural Society of Metropolitan Washington to support the cost of constructing a house for a differently-abled person in Mannar, Alappuzha. The entire project was designed, coordinated, and executed with the help of the Darsana Calicut Chapter. We have handed over the key to the beneficiary in a small function organized by the Kochin chapter presided over by Honorable Minister Com: Saji Cherian.
                    US chapter members have volunteered on our digital platform. Unlike other countries, only a few Indian-affiliated left progressive organizations in the North American region, making it difficult for Darsana to have a deeper ideological collaboration and cooperation. However, we have identified a few organizations with which we can have better affiliations and organize collaborative programs, like Art Lovers of America. Darsana US chapter is actively working to collaborate better with ALA and similar organizations.
                    However, the Darsana NA chapter also finds it relevant to work with a non-political cultural organization like the Kerala Association in North America, like FOKANA and FOMAA, to partner for their charity, Educational, and volunteer programs. Additionally, two Darsana members from the US attended the Loka Kerala Sabha regional conference in New York last year, where they actively participated in discussions and networking opportunities to further Darsana's goals and initiatives in the North American region.
                    In addition to the ongoing collaborations with Indian community organizations, the Darsana US chapter collaborates with the Bangalore chapter to provide nutritious food for children in Kolar Gold Field School. This initiative addresses nutrition deficiency among children in the KGF schools and promotes their overall well-being.
