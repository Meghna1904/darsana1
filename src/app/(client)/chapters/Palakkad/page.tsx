                    Palakkad chapter plays an active role in the planning, organization, campaigning, and execution of many programs of Darsana. The chapter has a 16-member coordination committee and regular online CC meetings are happening. The specific programs for which Palakkad chapter had a major role to play in the last year are listed below.

                    1.      IGNITE 2023
                    The Ignite project aims to create an ecosystem available to students, technologists, or anyone with a creative mind, to experiment, create, revise, and evolve along with our panel of technical experts and mentors. As part of this initiative, we have set up a platform called IGNITE, consisting of a web portal (www.ignite.darsana.in) as a medium of exchange and a team of academicians, senior professionals from various engineering streams, and experienced business owners to nurture the dream ideas into reality. Through the annual ‘IGNITE Innovation and Entrepreneurship Challenge’, we introduced this platform to the educational institutions in Kerala. The finale of this year’s edition was on 12 August 2023, at Govt. Polytechnic College, Palakkad. The chapter has been able to ensure active participation of its members in the successful running of the program. Our members are present in the leadership roles of the program as well.

                    1.1  MoU signing with KSUM
                    In a full day event held at Palakkad on 17 February 2023, various discussions were conducted to discuss and deliberate about the ways to tap the entrepreneurial potential of Malabar region in Kerala. The function was attended by eminent business stakeholders of Palakkad. Our members, Anirudhan, Vinod, Radhakrishnan, Niranjan, Krishna Mohan, Prasad Mathew, Ajith Mohan, Mukundhan, Farih, and Pradeep also attended the event representing Darsana. KSUM handed over the MoU signed with Darsana to Vinod P., treasurer, Darsana, furthering the cause of innovation and entrepreneurship in Kerala.

                    The chapter coordinated BCES house visits with the help of Trivandrum, Ernakulam, and Calicut chapters. Houses of students shortlisted for the BCES scholarship were visited by Darsana members to understand the situation of the students and finalize the beneficiaries for the scholarship. 16 new students were selected for the scholarship after proper verification of their background. The scholarship was distributed to the new beneficiaries on 26 February 2024.

                    3.             BCES Mentorship Program
                    The BCES beneficiaries of second and third year were allotted with mentors for any additional support that they may require. A team of mentors were formed from within the Palakkad chapter. All the mentors stayed in touch with their mentee(s) and contact them at least once in a month to enquire about and addressed their general wellbeing as well as academic concerns. A review meeting was held once a month for discussing the issues faced by the mentees and for ensuring timely interventions if required under the guidance of K. A. Nandajan – counsellor, trainer, mentor, and a member of the Darsana Palakkad chapter. Multiple workshops were conducted as part of the BCES Mentorship Program for the mentees and mentors.

                    ‘Break the Shackles’, a one-day workshop was organised for the mentees on 23 April 2023, at Sayoojyam Residency, Palakkad. 18 students and 10 mentors participated in the workshop. The workshop was led by K. A. Nandajan, Manoj Kumar, and Neeraj C. R., all of them Darsana Palakkad members. To accommodate the new batch of BCES beneficiaries in the program, new members were added to the mentors’ group. ‘Learn the Art of Mentoring’, a three-day online workshop (from 22 to 24 June 2023), was organised to prepare the new Mentors to face the challenges of mentoring and as a refresher course for the existing mentors. The program was organised and coordinated by the Palakkad chapter and saw the participation of over 20 members.
